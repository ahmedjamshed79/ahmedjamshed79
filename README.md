# 💫 About Me:
My name is Ahmed Faraz, and I am a front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional web experiences. With a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Griffith University Australia and 1 year of professional work experience, I specialise in using my skills to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Through my technical skills and expertise, I have delivered high-quality projects on time and within budget, always paying close attention to detail to ensure the best possible outcome.

I believe that the key to success in this industry is to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies, which is why I am constantly learning and expanding my skillset. Whether it's experimenting with new technologies, attending industry events and webinars or taking relevant courses, I am always seeking to improve my craft. I am also a strong communicator who enjoys building relationships with clients and team members.

When I'm not working on code, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, reading a good book, or spending time with family and friends.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!"
